#  Implementation of Research Paper: Brain-Tumor-Detection-with-CNNs

Implemented a comprehensive comparative analysis of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for brain tumor detection, leveraging insights from a research paper. This study involved the exploration of seven distinct CNN models, including VGG19, InceptionV3, MobileNet V2, ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, and a custom CNN model.

Utilizing a dataset consisting of 3000 RGB MRI images, both augmented and unaugmented data were employed to rigorously evaluate the performance of the CNN architectures. Through meticulous experimentation and analysis, the project aimed to identify the most effective model for brain tumor detection applications.

The results of the study showcased remarkable advancements in model accuracy, with the InceptionV3, MobileNet V2, and ResNet50 architectures achieving the highest accuracy of 99.1%. This marked enhancement, surpassing the existing accuracy of 92.4% by approximately 7%, underscores the efficacy of the implemented CNN models in accurately detecting brain tumors.
